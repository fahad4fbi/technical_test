Hi, below is my approach for the solution

1. I have created a simple page with vanilla javascript, as this was a simple task so avaoided any complexity of frameworks.
2. A note can be added by clicking any where on the map and filling in the username and note info. All added notes will be displayed on map
and they can be further searched by user. 
3. Type in the note or user name to search a note, click on it to go to the location.
4. As the time was short so I decided to skip the server side portion.
5. All notes are sotred in localstorage, so if server side work needs to be done just an api call need to be added
6. Did not used any fancy styles, just basic to get the job done.

Please have a look, I spent about 1:30 hours on it as I had not used google maps api before.
